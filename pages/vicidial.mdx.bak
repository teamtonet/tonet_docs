# Getting started with Tonet and VICIDial

Tonet offers hosted VICIDial systems, this is a convinient option where we create a VICIDial instance
for you on our infrastructure and configure the Tonet Trunks compatible with VICIDial for you.
Please contact us to learn more.

Tonet can also be used with your self hosted VICIDial system. All the information you need is documented on these help pages.
Start by configuring the [Trunks](/vicidial/tonet_trunk), and if you have never used VICIDial before please check out the manuals for [Agents](/vicidial/agents) and [Campaigns](/vicidial/campaigns).
