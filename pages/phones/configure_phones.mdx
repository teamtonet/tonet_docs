### Call Routing
    Call Routing Goes through the Following Process.
    When Your Phone Number is dialled:    
    1. **Calendar**: The Number checks if it has a Calendar currently active. i.e It is currently the 31st and you have a NYE calendar set.  
        If an active Calendar is found, the Number goes to the Calendar destination.
    2. **Schedule**: If no Calendar is selected or currently in range, The Phone checks if it is subscribed to any weekly Schedule. 
        If it is, it will follow the Scheduled routing, If not, Or the Schedule does not specify a destination for this hour of the week, it goes to:
    3. **Default**: Default is always the Default destination of a Phone if no Calendar or Schedule is Present.    

To Route Calls, Head over to the Phone Configuration Page: 

* Go to the [Phones tab](https://dashboard.tonet.ai/phones) in your tonet.ai Platform.  

* Click on the Phone Number you want to Configure.  

* Click on the Configure tab at the top if Not already highlighted.

        If Two Calendar Events interfere with each other and are selected, Phone will route to the first one it sees, as it has no way to understand your intent.
