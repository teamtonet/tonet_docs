## What is number porting?

Porting refers to the act of transferring a phone number from one telecom service provider to another, at the request of the end-user.
The procedure necessitates the submission of appropriate documentation to validate the number's ownership and requires
coordination between the current and new providers to finalize the date of porting.

Porting your US telephone number can take up to four four weeks depending on the type of number you are porting.

## What information is required?
* The authorized user or owner’s first and last name.
* The corresponding service address with your current provider. This must be an actual physical address.
* A Letter of Authorization ([LoA](/phones/port_number#what-is-a-loa-letter-of-authorization)) signed by the authorized user and/or owner of the number(s).
* A scanned (or electronic) copy of the most recent phone bill, within the last 30 days.

## What is a LoA (Letter of Authorization)?
The Letter of Authorization is a form used to release your number(s) from your current provider to Tonet.
This form must include your address information that your provider has on file for you as well as the phone number(s).

## What is a CSR (Customer Service Record)?
To minimize the risk of the port being rejected, it's advised to provide as much details as possible.
In many cases, the billing record and the customer service record will have the same information, but this is not necessarily going to be the case.
Therefore, it's best to ask specifically for the CSR.

To obtain a Customer Service Record (CSR), you'll need to contact your current carrier, and you may need to ask for your carrier's Porting Team.
Please specify that you want the customer service record on file with the carrier, not merely your billing records.

## What are some common resons a port request can be rejected?
While most phone numbers are portable, there are some frequent reasons why a request to port them may initially be declined by the current carrier.
However, in almost all situations, the legitimate user of the number can address these issues, enabling the port request to move forward.

### Unsatisfactory Business Relationship
This typically means that either you have an unpaid balance or the carrier charges a port away fee.
To resolve this rejection you must pay any outstanding balance/fee to your current carrier.

### All Data Mismatch / Name Mismatch / Address Mismatch
This means that the information you submitted on your Letter of Authorization (LOA) is different from what is on file with
your carrier in their Customer Service Record (CSR). A CSR is a copy of how your telephone records appear in the telephone company’s database.
In order to ensure a port request’s likely success, the information on the Letter of Authorization (LOA) – particularly the authorized user,
service address, and zip code – should exactly match the information on the CSR.

### Number is Inactive
Your numbers must be in service with the losing carrier.
To resolve this rejection, contact the losing carrier to reinstate the number.

### Wrong Wireless Account Pin
In order to port wireless numbers, you must submit a PIN. Please note that the PIN is sometimes the last four digits of the account holder’s Social Security Number.
