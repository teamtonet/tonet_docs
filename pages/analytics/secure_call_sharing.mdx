# Secure Call Sharing

Share call recordings and details instantly with anyone using secure, unique links. Our Call Sharing feature streamlines collaboration and quality assurance by allowing authorized users to generate public links to specific calls, complete with recordings and detailed analytics.

## Key Benefits

* **Instant Sharing:** Generate secure links in seconds to share call recordings and details with team members, supervisors, or stakeholders
* **Secure Access:** Each shared call uses a unique, randomly generated URL that can only be accessed by those who have the link
* **Flexible Control:** Remove access at any time by deactivating the public link, or generate a new link as needed
* **Complete Information:** Shared calls include all relevant details and recordings, providing full context to recipients

## How to Share a Call

## Managing Shared Calls

### Removing Access

1. Return to the call in your Analytics page
2. Open the sharing modal for the call
3. Click "Remove Public Link"
4. The previous link will become inactive immediately

### Creating a New Link
If you need to share the call again after removing access:

1. Follow the same steps to share the call
2. Click "Create Public Link"
3. A new, unique link will be generated
4. The previous link remains inactive for security

### Security Considerations

* Each shared call uses a unique, randomly generated URL that cannot be guessed
* Links can be deactivated at any time to prevent further access
* Generating a new link for a call does not reactivate previously removed links
