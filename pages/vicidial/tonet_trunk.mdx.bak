# Tonet Trunk with VICIdial

__1. Ask Tonet Support to prepare your user for vicidial__

Contact Tonet to enable support for vicidial. Vicidial support will be enabled on one user which will be used for the vicidial trunk.

__2. Retrieve the needed SIP details__

Collect the necessary SIP information from Tonet’s dashboard in Users -> User designated for Vicidial -> SIP Information. You will need username, password, domain and port. 

__2. Assign a phone number for incoming calls__

Create or select a phone number to be used for incoming calls to the trunk on Tonet’s dashboard in Phones.
Route the number to the designated VICIdial user in the Configure tab. You can route several numbers at once to the same user.

<Callout type="info" emoji="ℹ️">
  Any number you own in Tonet can be used as outgoing caller-id in VICIdial.
</Callout>
