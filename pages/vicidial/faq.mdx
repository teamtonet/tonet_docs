# Vicidial FAQ

__"Sorry, there are no leads in the hopper for this campaign" when agent login__\
If this is an empty campaign but you want to allow agents to login and manually dial you need to change
the "Allow No-Hopper-Leads Logins" setting for the campaign to Y.

If you have loaded leads to this campaign, make sure that there are valid leads in the hopper.
Go to Campaign - Scroll all the way to the bottom and check the leads in the hopper.

__"Dial timed out, contact your system administrator"__ or\
__"Call Rejected: CHANUNAVAIL"__\
Most likely the trunk is not configured correctly. Take a look at the [Tonet Trunk](/vicidial/tonet_trunk) help page
and verify your settings. If it's still not working please contact your VICIDial Administrator.

__I've added an inbound number but VICIDial doesn't recieve the calls__\
Note that Tonet sends calls with DNID (dialed number identifier) in E.164 format with a plus sign (+).
The DID Extension field in VICIDial need to be the same.\
If VICIDial does not pick up the calls make sure that it is configured to handle DNID with a plus sign.
