#### Setting Routes To Groups (Example 1)

For the sake of simplification, we're going to set an example of setting routes in a software company.

Software company XYZ has two main departments who can receive phone calls, sales and customer service.

1. Create a main auto attendant.
2. Record the main intro message, it will be something along the lines of "Welcome to XYZ, for sales press 1, for customer service press 2"

![record](https://i.imgur.com/NEdBY9s.jpg)

3. Click save when you're satisfied with the recording.

![save](https://i.imgur.com/Qw9BBPN.jpg)

4. Click Add Route.

![route](https://i.imgur.com/30YxZHE.jpg)

5. Click the number 1.

![number1](https://i.imgur.com/vIGBgPC.jpg)

6. Click on the button to redirect.

![press1](https://i.imgur.com/aIrasMj.jpg)

6. Set the route to Group named "Sales".

![sales](https://i.imgur.com/jTAODBA.jpg)

7. Click Add Route again.
8. Select number 2.

![number2](https://i.imgur.com/q4ePeUU.jpg)

9. Click on the button to redirect.

![press2](https://i.imgur.com/ESaQtbq.jpg)

![customerservice](https://i.imgur.com/CLPwg4L.jpg)

11. Once you're done, click Update.

![updatemain2](https://i.imgur.com/afwUMK7.jpg)

You can create groups from the groups section of your dashboard.

Now when the client presses 1 on their phone, they will be redirected to the Sales group, and whoever is available (online and not on a call) from the users in that group will get the call.

If the user is on a call, call queue will be automatically activated and the client will be informed that he is in a queue, and if everyone is offline, then it will go to the voicemail of this group.

And if the client presses 2 on their phone, they will be redirected to the Customer Service group, and whoever is available (online and not on a call) from the users in that group will get the call.

If the user is on a call, call queue will be automatically activated and the client will be informed that he is in a queue, and if everyone is offline, then it will go to the voicemail of this group.

#### Setting Routes To Individuals (Example 2)

In this example, we're going to show how to route to specific individuals in a company.
