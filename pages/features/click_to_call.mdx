# Click-to-Call and Highlight-to-Dial

Tap any clickable phone number to call instantly. This feature works across browsers, email clients, calendar apps, and Microsoft Office. For this functionality to work properly, phone numbers must use the **tel:** protocol in their hyperlinks.

2. When your browser displays a permission prompt, click "Allow" to enable this feature
3. **Chrome on Mac users only:** Go to chrome://settings/handlers and set Tonet as the default handler for tel: links

**Important:** Keep dashboard.tonet.ai open in your browser for click-to-dial functionality to work properly.
Any **tel:** link you click will initiate a call through Tonet.
