# Groups

Groups allow you to create groups of users, you can include a certain department in a group so that this group can receive calls, for example, you can create a customer service group, [set the auto-attendant](https://docs.tonet.ai/auto_attendant) to redirect to the customer service when the client presses 2, and one of the available group members will be able to take the call once it comes in.

Once you are done, click Save.
